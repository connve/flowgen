# Quick Start

This guide walks you through creating your first flowgen flow.

## Prerequisites

- Flowgen binary ([Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation))
- NATS JetStream (optional — for distributed cache, messaging, leader election)

## Your first flow

Create a file called `hello.yaml`:

```yaml
flow:
  name: hello_world
  tasks:
    - generate:
        name: ticker
        interval: "5s"
        code: |
          #{
            message: "hello from flowgen",
            timestamp: timestamp_now()
          }

    - script:
        name: transform
        code: |
          let data = event.data;
          #{
            original: data.message,
            processed_at: timestamp_to_iso(timestamp_now()),
            uppercased: data.message.to_upper()
          }

    - log:
        name: output
```

This flow generates an event every 5 seconds, transforms it with a Rhai script, and logs the result.

## Configuration

Flowgen reads its configuration from a YAML file (`config.yaml`). A minimal setup only needs `flows.path`:

```yaml
flows:
  path: /etc/flowgen/flows/
```

Full configuration with all sections:

```yaml
# Distributed cache (NATS KV). Falls back to in-memory if disabled or unavailable.
cache:
  enabled: true
  type: nats
  credentials_path: /etc/nats/credentials.json
  url: nats://localhost:4222
  db_name: flowgen_cache
  # history: 10
  # tombstone_ttl: "1h"

# Flow discovery. Recursively loads all .yaml/.yml/.json files.
flows:
  path: /etc/flowgen/flows/
  # Cache-backed flow loading (for git-synced flows):
  # cache:
  #   enabled: true
  #   prefix: "flows."
  #   db_name: flowgen_system

# External resource files (SQL, templates, scripts).
resources:
  path: /etc/flowgen/resources/
  # cache:
  #   enabled: true
  #   prefix: "resources."
  #   db_name: flowgen_system

# OpenTelemetry metrics and tracing.
# telemetry:
#   enabled: true
#   otlp_endpoint: "http://localhost:4317"
#   service_name: flowgen
#   metrics_export_interval: "60s"

worker:
  # HTTP server for webhooks, AI gateway, health checks.
  http_server:
    enabled: true
    port: 3000
    # path: "/api/flowgen/workers"
    # credentials_path: /etc/http/credentials.json

  # MCP server for exposing flows as LLM tools.
  # mcp_server:
  #   enabled: true
  #   port: 3001
  #   path: "/mcp"

  # event_buffer_size: 10000000
```

Without cache configured, flowgen uses an in-memory cache (single-node). See [Caching](/docs/concepts/caching) for details.

## Running

```bash
flowgen --config config.yaml
```

Flowgen discovers all YAML files in the configured flows directory and starts processing them.

## What happens under the hood

1. Flowgen loads all flow YAML files from the configured path.
2. For each flow, it creates internal event channels connecting tasks in sequence.
3. The `generate` task produces events on the configured interval.
4. Each event flows through the `script` task for transformation.
5. The `log` task prints the final event to stdout.
