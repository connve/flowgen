# Configuration

Flowgen reads a single YAML file (passed via `--config`). Top-level sections:

```yaml
flows:             # Flow discovery (required).
cache:             # Distributed cache backend (optional).
resources:         # External resource loading (optional).
http_server:       # Webhook / metrics HTTP server (optional).
mcp_server:        # MCP server for tools/resources/prompts (optional).
ai_gateway:        # OpenAI-compatible LLM gateway (optional).
web:               # Admin web UI (optional).
health:            # k8s liveness/readiness listener (defaults on).
retry:             # Default retry policy for every task (optional).
event_buffer_size: # Per-edge channel capacity (optional).
telemetry:         # OpenTelemetry export (optional).
```

Only `flows` is required. Every other section has working defaults.

## Minimal config

```yaml
flows:
  path: /etc/flowgen/flows/
```

Discovers every `.yaml`/`.yml`/`.json` file under the path and runs them with an in-memory cache, no resources directory, no HTTP server, and no telemetry.

## `flows`

Flow discovery. Filesystem and distributed cache can be used independently or together; flowgen merges flows from both sources at startup.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | | Directory or glob pattern. Filesystem-mode loads every `.yaml`/`.yml`/`.json` file recursively. Omit to skip filesystem loading. |
| `cache` | object | | Cache-mode flow loading. Loads flows from the metadata cache in addition to the filesystem. |
| `cache.enabled` | bool | required | Enable cache-mode flow loading. |
| `cache.prefix` | string | `flows` | Cache key prefix for flow entries. |
| `cache.db_name` | string | `flowgen_system` | Cache bucket holding the flow definitions. |

Both sources can be active at the same time. Use this for gradual migration: a small set of bootstrap flows mounted from disk (typically a sync flow that pulls user flows from Git into the cache), with the bulk of user flows loaded from the cache. On a name collision the filesystem entry wins, so a locally mounted bootstrap flow cannot be silently overridden by a stale cache entry.

Cache-mode flow loading is useful when flows are provisioned dynamically — for example, a control plane writes flow YAML into NATS KV and every flowgen replica picks them up.

## `cache`

Distributed cache backend. When omitted, flowgen uses an in-memory cache (single-node only).

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | required | Set `false` to fall back to in-memory cache. |
| `type` | string | required | Backend type. Currently `nats`. |
| `credentials_path` | string | optional | Path to NATS credentials file. |
| `url` | string | `localhost:4222` | NATS server URL. |
| `db_name` | string | `flowgen_cache` | KV bucket name. |
| `history` | int | `64` | Historical entries retained per key. Only applies when the bucket is created. Server caps at 64. |
| `tombstone_ttl` | duration | `1h` | TTL for delete/purge tombstones. Required for per-key TTLs on cache entries to work. |

If NATS is configured but unreachable, flowgen falls back to in-memory automatically and logs a warning. See [Caching](/docs/flowgen/concepts/caching).

## `resources`

External resource loading for SQL queries, prompts, scripts, schemas. See [Resources](/docs/flowgen/concepts/resources).

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | | Filesystem base directory for resources. Resource keys resolve relative to this path. |
| `cache` | object | | Cache-backed resources. When `cache.enabled` is true, resources load from the cache. |
| `cache.enabled` | bool | required | Enable cache-backed resources. |
| `cache.prefix` | string | `resources` | Cache key prefix for resource entries. |
| `cache.db_name` | string | `flowgen_system` | Cache bucket holding resource entries. |

When `resources` is omitted, only inline content is supported — any task that uses `{ resource: ... }` will fail at startup with a clear error.

## `http_server`

HTTP server that hosts every `http_endpoint` route plus health/metrics endpoints.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | required | Required for `http_endpoint` tasks to start. |
| `port` | int | `3000` | Listening port. |
| `path` | string | | Optional path prefix applied to every registered route. |
| `credentials_path` | string | | Shared bearer/basic credentials. Tasks override per-route. See [Credentials](/docs/flowgen/concepts/credentials). |
| `auth` | object | | User-level authentication provider (JWT, OIDC, session). See [Authentication](/docs/flowgen/concepts/auth). |

## `mcp_server`

MCP server for exposing `mcp_tool`, `mcp_resource`, and `mcp_prompt` tasks to LLM clients.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | required | Required for any MCP task to register. |
| `port` | int | `3001` | Listening port. |
| `path` | string | `/mcp/v1` | MCP endpoint path. |
| `credentials_path` | string | | Shared API key credentials. Individual tools can override. |
| `auth` | object | | User-level authentication provider (JWT, OIDC, session). See [Authentication](/docs/flowgen/concepts/auth). |
| `resource_uri_scheme` | string | `flowgen` | Scheme used when auto-generating `mcp_resource` URIs of the form `<scheme>://<flow_name>/<name>`. White-label deployments override this. |

## `ai_gateway`

OpenAI-compatible LLM gateway that serves every registered `llm_proxy` flow.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | required | Required for `llm_proxy` tasks to be registered. |
| `port` | int | `3002` | Listening port, independent of the webhook HTTP server. |
| `path` | string | `/v1` | Path prefix for AI gateway routes. The chat completions endpoint is served at `<path>/chat/completions`. |
| `credentials_path` | string | | Path to global credentials file. Individual `llm_proxy` tasks can override. |
| `auth` | object | | User-level authentication provider (JWT, OIDC, session). See [Authentication](/docs/flowgen/concepts/auth). |

## `web`

Embedded admin dashboard and read-only JSON API.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | required | Set `true` to start the server. |
| `port` | int | `8080` | Listening port. |
| `path` | string | `/` | Path prefix for both the UI and the API. |
| `headers` | map of string to string | `{}` | HTTP headers sent with every outbound request the admin server makes on its own behalf (currently the built-in Agents chat proxy to the AI gateway). Set this so `llm_proxy`/`mcp_tool` tasks scoped with a matching `headers` field can identify and allow the admin server as a caller — see [AI Gateway](/docs/flowgen/ai/gateway) and [MCP](/docs/flowgen/ai/mcp). |

The API contract is defined in `openapi.yaml` and served at `<path>/api/openapi.yaml`.

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET <path>/api/flows` | List loaded flows with live counters. |
| `GET <path>/api/flows/{name}` | Full YAML source of one flow. |
| `GET <path>/api/flows/stream` | Server-Sent Events of live per-flow metrics: one `snapshot` frame with every flow's counters on connect, then a `snapshot` frame per change. Event/log history and live tail come from `/api/logs` and `/api/logs/stream` instead. |
| `GET <path>/api/logs` | Retained log records — framework, lifecycle, and per-task activity. Accepts `?limit=` (default 500, max 10000) and `?flow=` to scope to one flow's records. |
| `GET <path>/api/logs/stream` | Server-Sent Events live tail of log records as they arrive, same `?flow=` scoping as `/api/logs`. |
| `GET <path>/api/resources` | List discoverable resources. |
| `GET <path>/api/resources/{key}` | Fetch one resource's content. |
| `GET <path>/api/version` | Running build version. |
| `GET <path>/api/config` | Non-secret config info shown in the admin UI (e.g. whether the Agents chat is configured). |
| `POST <path>/api/agents/chat` | Proxies a chat-completion request to the AI gateway for the built-in Agents chat. Streams the response back; same-origin, so no gateway-side CORS is required. |
| `GET <path>/api/agents/models` | Proxies `GET /models` on the AI gateway for the built-in Agents chat's model picker. |
| `GET <path>/api/openapi.yaml` | The spec itself. |

## `health`

Kubernetes liveness/readiness listener.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Enable the listener. |
| `port` | int | `8081` | Listening port. |

| Endpoint | Response |
|---|---|
| `GET /livez` | `200 OK`. |
| `GET /readyz` | `200 OK` once at least one flow is registered, `503` before. |
| `GET /healthz` | Alias of `/livez`. |

## `retry`

Sets the default retry policy for every task. Individual tasks can override via their own `retry` field.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_attempts` | int / null | `10` | Maximum attempts before giving up. `null` for infinite retries. |
| `initial_backoff` | duration | `1s` | Delay before first retry. Each subsequent retry doubles, with jitter. |

See [Retry](/docs/flowgen/concepts/retry) for the two retry patterns (circuit breaker for processors, infinite reconnect for subscribers).

## `event_buffer_size`

Each pair of connected tasks shares a bounded mpsc channel. `event_buffer_size` sets the channel capacity (in events). When the channel fills, the upstream task blocks until the downstream task drains a slot — this is how backpressure propagates through the flow. No events are dropped.

The default (10,000) is sufficient for most workloads. The buffer only needs to absorb the gap between producer and consumer processing rates; downstream throughput is determined by task processing speed, not channel depth. Increase it if you observe producer stalls in flows with very bursty fan-out patterns and fast consumers.

## `telemetry`

OpenTelemetry providers for metrics, traces, and logs. See [Telemetry](/docs/flowgen/concepts/telemetry).

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | required | Set `true` to initialize the provider. |
| `backend` | object | in-memory | Backend selection. Omit for the in-memory backend. |
| `backend.type` | string | — | Either `memory` or `remote`. |
| `backend.endpoint` | string | — | Required for `remote`. gRPC endpoint of the collector. |
| `backend.logs_per_flow` | usize | `1000` | Memory backend only. Log records retained per flow. |
| `backend.metrics_per_flow` | usize | `1000` | Memory backend only. Metric samples retained per flow. |
| `service_name` | string | `flowgen` | `service.name` resource attribute. |
| `metrics_export_interval` | duration | `60s` | How often metric snapshots are pushed. Ignored by the memory backend. |

When `telemetry` is omitted entirely, no telemetry stack is started.

## Running

```bash
flowgen --config /etc/flowgen/config.yaml
```

Flowgen validates the config at startup. Any field with a typo, missing required value, or invalid type produces an error before any flow runs.
